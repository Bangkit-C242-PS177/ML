# ðŸ§  This Is The ML Path For Capstone Project "Urkins" ðŸ§ 
There are two models for our mobile applications: Skin Conditions Model and Skin Type Model.

## Skin Type Model
Skin type model uses RestNet50 for transfer learning because its good at recognising texture, so for our apllication to detect user skin type our model model has to be able to clasify the user skin texture accurately, wether it is dry, oily, or normal.

## Skin Conditions Model
Skin condition model uses MobileNetV2 for transfer learning because its good at recignising shape and pattern, so for our application to detect user ksin conditions our model has to able to clasify the user skin pattern, like acne and shape like eye bags.
