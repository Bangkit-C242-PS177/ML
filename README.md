## 🔍 **Models Overview**  

Our application integrates two specialized models, each designed to handle a specific aspect of skin analysis:  

### 🧠 **Skin Type Model**  
- **Architecture**: ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)  
- **Why ResNet50?**  
   ResNet50 excels at recognizing textures, making it ideal for detecting and classifying skin types. Our model can accurately categorize the user's skin texture into one of three types: **dry**, **oily**, or **normal**.  
- **Goal**: Ensure precise skin type classification to provide users with the most relevant skincare recommendations.  

### 🧠 **Skin Conditions Model**  
- **Architecture**: MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)  
- **Why MobileNetV2?**  
   MobileNetV2 is optimized for identifying shapes and patterns, crucial for detecting skin conditions. This model classifies skin irregularities, such as **acne**, and features like **eye bags**, providing actionable insights for users.  
- **Goal**: Enable accurate detection of skin conditions to guide users in addressing specific concerns effectively.

## 🛠️ **Testing Framework**  

To ensure the robustness and reliability of our models, we employ **Streamlit** for testing.  
- **Purpose**: Identify and resolve potential bugs or errors in the models before deployment.  
- **Benefits**: Streamlit provides an intuitive interface for seamless testing, allowing us to validate model performance in real-time.
